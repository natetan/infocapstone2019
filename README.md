### An automated text-message based blood donor system
With our system we are primarily trying to address the following issues:
1. Encourage involvement of first time donors by offering a quick method of getting involved with the process of blood donation. 
2. Increase donor retention by integrating features such as donation eligibility reminders, urgent donation alerts and mobile pre-screening forms.

Our application uses the Twilio's SMS API in order to facilitate the text messaging system and firebase to store user information.  

Blood Pact offers 3 core features:  

>Locate nearest blood drives and times.
>
>Mark your recent donation.
>
>Get your personal statistics.  

Some other features that we will be pushing out next quarter are:  

>Checking eligibility date to donate.
>
>Pre-assessment form in order to speed up the process of blood donation.
